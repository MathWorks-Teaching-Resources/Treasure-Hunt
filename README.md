**Curriculum Module**  
_Created with R2022b. Compatible with R2022b and later releases._ 

## Description ##
This curriculum module contains interactive [live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) that teach fundamental concepts and basic terminology related to programming computers. This includes discussion of variables, matrices, conditional statements, strings, arrays, indexing and functions. 

These lessons can be used as part of a lecture, as activities in an instructional setting, or as interactive assignments to be completed outside class.

Please contact the <a href="mailto:onlineteaching@mathworks.com">MathWorks online teaching team</a> with any feedback or questions.

## Get started with the Treasure Hunt Game: Learn to Code interactive examples ##

**Option 1: Download to Desktop** Download and unzip the repository. Then, double-click the TreasureHunt.prj file inside MATLAB&reg;. 

**Option 2: [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Treasure-Hunt&project=TreasureHunt.prj)** Log in to your MathWorks account to access your license. If you are associated with a university, use your university email to access a license.

- The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the exercises and activities. 
- Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. 
- To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, if a loop is running longer than intended), click the <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88841524/182219991-17ef7bf9-369b-4463-8de6-9e440ca3bc9b.png"> **Stop** button in the **RUN** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.

## Prerequisite Domain Knowledge ##
This module assumes an ability to identify and plot X,Y points on a grid. It is also intended for those who have an understanding of basic computer science concepts, such as syntax, variables, and arrays. If you would like more practice with these concepts, we recommend trying the set of exercises in [Fundamentals of Programming](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/103225-fundamentals-of-programming?s_tid=srchtitle).
